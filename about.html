        <p class="description">
          I’m a self-driven and passionate learner with a deep interest in web development and artificial intelligence. 
          My academic journey started in a disciplined convent school environment, which laid the foundation for my dedication and focus. 
          After 10th grade, I moved to Kota to pursue IIT preparation—a phase that taught me perseverance despite not achieving the final goal. 
          That experience didn’t break my determination; instead, it made me stronger. 
          I later joined BMS Institute of Technology in Bangalore through COMEDK, where I’ve been actively developing my skills in full-stack web development and AI. 
          From day one, I’ve been committed to learning and evolving—spending time building projects, understanding real-world problems, and exploring new technologies. 
          My ultimate goal is to become a skilled MERN developer and AI specialist who builds impactful digital solutions.
